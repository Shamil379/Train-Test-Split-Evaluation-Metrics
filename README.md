## 📊 Heart Disease Prediction – Model Training & Evaluation
## 📁 Dataset

heart.csv

Contains medical attributes used to predict the presence of heart disease.

## 🎯 Objective

To train a simple machine learning model and evaluate its performance in predicting heart disease.

## 🛠️ Steps Performed
1. Train–Test Split

The dataset was split into 80% training data and 20% testing data.

Training set is used to train the model.

Testing set is used to evaluate model performance on unseen data.

2. Model Training

A Logistic Regression model was trained.

Logistic Regression is suitable for binary classification problems like heart disease prediction.

3. Prediction

The trained model was used to make predictions on the test dataset.

4. Model Evaluation

The following evaluation metrics were calculated:

Accuracy

Precision

Recall

Confusion Matrix

These metrics help assess how well the model performs, especially in identifying patients with heart disease.

5. Interpretation

The model achieved good accuracy and high recall.

High recall is important in medical applications to reduce missed diagnoses.

The model serves as a strong baseline classifier.

## 📌 Conclusion

This project demonstrates a complete machine learning workflow including data splitting, model training, prediction, and evaluation using a real-world healthcare dataset.
